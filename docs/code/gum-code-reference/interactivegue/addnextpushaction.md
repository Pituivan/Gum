# AddNextPushAction

## Introduction

AddNextPushAction adds a delegate to be raised the next time the Cursor performs a primary push. This call is not bound to a particular control, and it can be used to handle when a control is clicked off of the control. This method is used internally to close Menus and ComboBoxes.
